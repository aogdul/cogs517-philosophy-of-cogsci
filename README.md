LECTURER: Cem Bozsahin (Spring 2018) TA: Firat Oter

LECTURES: Wednesdays 14.40-17.30, Room S-01 at Informatics.

BACKGROUND REQUIREMENTS: Basic understanding of cognitive science at the level of COGS501 and COGS502. Or some backgorund in philosophy or AI.

COURSE IN RELATION TO THE PROGRAM: It is a departmental elective course in the Philosophy track of Cognitive Science. It can be taken as elective by other departments.

COURSE OBJECTIVES: One can study these topics in the philosophical tradition, as philosophy of mind. One can also see the contents as philosophy for cognitive science, i.e. covering schools and practices of philosophy for the benefit of the cognitive scientist. This course is neither. It is about the philosophy of cognitive science from the inside, as cognitive scientists encounter scientific and philosophical problems, more like in a philosophy of science tradition, except that it's covered by a scientist rather than a philosopher in current offering.

So, why this course? Remember: We wouldn't need CogSci if Cognitive Psychology were successful. We wouldn't need CogSci if AI were successful. We wouldn't need CogSci if Philosophy of Mind were successful. We wouldn't need CogSci if the so-called Cognitive Revolution in Linguistics were successful. Inquiring minds want to know why they failed (to deliver).
